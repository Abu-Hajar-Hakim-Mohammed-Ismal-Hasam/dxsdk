This repository combines headers of several DXSDK, to facilitate Windows builds
of [Apitrace](https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace).

apitrace targets many DirectX APIs, several of which have been deprecated and
can no longer be found on DirectX SDK.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace/wiki/DirectXSDK) for more
information on the versions of DirectX SDK.
